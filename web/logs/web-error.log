Description:

Failed to auto-configure a DataSource: 'spring.datasource.url' is not specified and no embedded datasource could be auto-configured.

Reason: Failed to determine a suitable driver class


Action:

Consider the following:
	If you want an embedded database (H2, HSQL or Derby), please put it on the classpath.
	If you have database settings to be loaded from a particular profile you may need to activate it (no profiles are currently active).
